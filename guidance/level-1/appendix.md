# Appendix

**[< Previous: Development & Support](./development-and-support.md)**

This section provides references and additional information that may benefit readers, including historical security data, project comparisons, and best practice alignment.

## Known Issues Over Time

If the project has encountered vulnerabilities in the past, summarize key statistics and link to reports. If no vulnerabilities have been reported, provide insight into security measures that have prevented issues, such as:

- Track record of catching issues in **code review** or **automated testing**
- Number of security fixes in past releases
- Metrics from static analysis or fuzzing tests

[+ View Security Issue Tracker](../security/issues.md)

## OpenSSF Best Practices

Discuss the project's alignment with [OpenSSF Best Practices](https://openssf.org/). Consider:

- Whether the project has obtained an OpenSSF Best Practices Badge
- Gaps that need to be addressed to achieve compliance
- Plans for improving adherence to security best practices

[+ Check OpenSSF Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/)

## Case Studies

Provide real-world examples of how the project has been used. These scenarios help reviewers understand security considerations in practical applications.

Example:
> *A financial institution integrated Flibber to encrypt cloud-based virtual machines, reducing unauthorized access incidents by 85%.*

## Related Projects & Vendors

Prospective users may compare your project to similar solutions. Address common questions by listing:

- **Competing or complementary projects**
- **Key differentiators** (e.g., performance, security focus, integrations)
- **Relevant vendors** that provide commercial support

Example:

> *Flibber vs. Noodles: Unlike Noodles, Flibber provides built-in encryption without requiring additional configuration.*

## OpenSSF Scorecard

If your project uses the OpenSSF Scorecard, include a reference to your latest score.
