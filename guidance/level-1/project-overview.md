# Project Overview

**[< Previous: Metadata](./metadata.md)**

This section introduces your project and its purpose, helping reviewers quickly understand its significance and context.

## Background

Provide essential context for reviewers who may not be familiar with your project's domain. Describe the problem your project addresses, the approach it takes to solve it, and the typical users who benefit from it.

## Security Goals

Clearly outline the security guarantees your project aims to provide. These should be specific assurances that define the security scope, such as access control measures, data protection strategies, or authentication mechanisms.

For example: "Flibble only allows parties with an authorization key to change data it stores."

## Security Non-goals

Define what your project explicitly does not aim to achieve. This helps set realistic expectations for users and reviewers while preventing misunderstandings about security responsibilities.

For example: "Flibble does not intend to stop a party with a key from storing an arbitrarily large amount of data, possibly incurring financial cost or overwhelming the servers."
